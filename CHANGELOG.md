# Changelog

## 1.1.2

### Improvements
- Fixed "terminated" / "request failed" errors when connecting to LM Studio and similar servers
- Replaced `TextDecoderStream` + `pipeThrough` with plain `TextDecoder` to avoid stream termination in certain runtimes
- Gracefully handle stream disconnection when data has already been received (some servers close without sending `[DONE]`)
- Added `\r\n` line ending support in SSE stream parsing
- Only send `top_p`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty` when non-default to avoid rejection by servers that don't accept unknown parameters
- Only send `parallel_tool_calls` when enabled (LM Studio rejects this field)
- Improved "terminated" error messages with actionable troubleshooting steps
- Added LM Studio to compatible servers list, keywords, and README setup guide

## 1.1.1

### Bug Fixes
- Prevented premature message truncation caused by an overly conservative token estimate. We now compute a real input-token estimate for the full conversation first and only truncate when it truly exceeds the available context window. This resolves cases where input was truncated despite ample room.
- Clearer token budgeting: context is now calculated as `model_context - desired_output - tools_overhead - buffer` and truncation is gated on the real estimate against this value.

## 1.1.0

- Fixed UTF-8 decoding issues causing garbled characters (e.g. arrows) by implementing `TextDecoderStream`
